This is a sample project that shows how to use
[Kotlin Compose for Web](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/#compose-html).

The project was used as a demo for the talk [Intro to Jetpack Compose for Web at 
VlbgWebDev](https://www.meetup.com/vlbgwebdev/events/293909965/).

## Getting Started

Run the application with the following command:

./gradlew jsRun
```

To run the application and enable hot reloading use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew jsRun -t

A new browser window will open with the application running on `http://localhost:3000`.
